### Overview of PIM-ANNS

This figure shows the workflow of an ANNS query in PIM-ANNS.
It supposes PU_0 is overloaded. 
Our per-PU query dispatching will dispatch this query to the replica on PU_1.

## Environment Setup

**To artifact reviewers:** please skip this section and go to **Evaluate the Artifact**.
This is because we have already set up the required environment on the provided platform.


### Prerequisites
**Hardware Requirements:** To run this project, UPMEM hardware is required.  https://www.upmem.com/

**Software Requirements:** Additionally, we also need setup the following software environment.

- UPMEM-SDK: This project uses a modified version of UPMEM-SDK based on the 2024.2 release. Original SDK: http://sdk-releases.upmem.com/2024.2.0/ubuntu_22.04/upmem-2024.2.0-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz. Installation script (Note: Modify the installation path in `install.sh` to your preferred location):
```bash
cd third-party/upmem-2024.2.0-Linux-x86_64
cd src/backends
bash ./install.sh
```
- FAISS: The IVFPQ index algorithm reuses portions of the FAISS codebase. For better UPMEM compatibility, we provide a modified version of FAISS based on: https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss. Installation method is the same as FAISS.

```bash
cd third-party/faiss_upmem
cmake -B build .
make -C build -j faiss
make -C build install
```

- Boost Coroutine: This project utilizes Boost's coroutine library. Thus, please install the libboost with the following commands.


```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install libboost-all-dev
```


## Evaluate the Artifact

### Login to the server we provide

We have provided a pre-configured server for AE reviewers.
The project directory is located at workspace/PIM-ANNS.




```bash
ssh -p 12853 wupuqing@44be1613b0de8118.natapp.cc

cd workspace/PIM-ANNS
```

### Building PIM-ANNS from source

Please simply use the CMake building system.

```bash
cmake -B build .
cd build
make -j
```

### Hello-world example

To verify that everything is prepared, you can run a hello-world example that verifies PIM-ANNS's functionality, please run the following command:

```bash
AE/hello_world.sh
```

It will run for approximately 1 minute and, on success, output something like below:

```bash
yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
json_path: /home/wupuqing/workspace/PIM-ANNS/config.json
query path is /mnt/optane/wpq/dataset/space/query10K.i8bin
query_num: 10000, dim: 100
searching SPACE1M, nprobe = 11
The command ./main 11 completed successfully.
```

If you can see this output, then everything is OK, and you can start running the artifact.

### Run all experiments


We provide convenient scripts for running either all experiments collectively (\#1) or individual experiments selectively (\#2).

**#1: Running the all-in-one script.** We provide an all-in-one AE script for running all experiments end-to-endly:

```
AE/run_all.sh
```

This script will run for approximately 8 hours and store all results in the **AE** directory.

**#2: Running specific experiments.** If you wish to replicate only specific experiments, we provide nine separate scripts corresponding to different experimental settings. These scripts, located in the `AE/exps/expX.sh` files (where X = 1, 2, ..., 8), can be used to reproduce all the figures presented in our paper.
The name of all scripts (i.e., `expX.sh`) are aligned with those presented in our main paper.

If you want to run individual experiments, please refer to these script files and the comments in them (which describes the relationship between experiments and `figures/tables`). 

Estimated running hours of experiments are shown in the Table below.


| Experiment | Description                                | Duration (hours) |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------|
| EXP1       | Overall throughput                         | 1.5              |
| EXP2       | End-to-end latency                         | 1.5              |
| EXP3       | PIM utilization                            | 1.5              |
| EXP4       | Coroutine-based bus ownership switching    | 1.0              |
| EXP5       | Effect of selective replication            | 0.5              |
| EXP6       | Contributions of individual techniques     | 1.0              |
| EXP7       | Comparison with Faiss-GPU                  | 0.5              |
| EXP8       | Cost efficiency                            | 0.2              |


### Plot the figures & tables

We provide two alternative ways to visualize the experimental results. 

**#1: (Recommended) All-in-one jupyter notebook for Visual Studio Code users.**

Please install the Jupyter extension in VSCode.
Then, please open `AE/plot.ipynb`.

Please activate the virtual environment (.venv/bin/python) by running the following commands.

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```


Then, you can run each cell from top to bottom.
Each cell will plot a figure or table like below.
Titles of these figures and tables are consistent with those in the paper.


<img src="figures/results1.png" alt="Throughput comparison" width="500">




**#2: Traditional python plotting scripts.**

We provide a traditional plotter script. 
Please run it in the AE directory:

```shell
cd AE
python3 plot.py
```


The command above will plot all figures and tables by default, and the results will be stored in the AE/figures directory.
So, please ensure that you have finished running the all-in-one AE script before running the plotter.

<img src="figures/results.png" alt="Throughput comparison" width="500">


The plotter further allows users to specify particular figures or tables to generate by providing supplementary command-line arguments.
For example:



```
python3 plot.py exp1 exp2
```

Please refer to `plot.py` for accepted arguments.
```
python3 plot.py help
```




### Detailed claims & Experimental result verification

3. **Combined Techniques (Exp6)**:  
   - Persistent PIM kernel alone improves throughput by **30–70%**.  
   - Adding per-PU dispatching further increases gains to **88–112%** (Figure 15).  

**Verification**:  
- Ablation studies (Figures 13–15) using config flags to enable/disable techniques.

<!-- # Data Preparation

## Datasets
Example datasets: sift1B and space1B  
- sift1B: http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/  
- space1B: https://github.com/microsoft/SPTAG/tree/main/datasets/SPACEV1B  

Following the approach from https://big-ann-benchmarks.com/neurips21.html, we trimmed space1B to retain:
- First 1 billion dataset vectors  
- 10,000 query vectors  

Training scripts:
- `./train_sift1B`: On a 40-logical-core CPU, training takes ~27 hours with default parameters  
- space1B follows similar training procedure  

## Dataset Configuration
Modify `config.json` to switch datasets. Example configuration (parameter names are self-explanatory; `RESULT_DIR` stores query test results):
```json
{
  "MAX_CLUSTER": 4096,
  "RESULT_DIR": "SPACE1B20M4096_DIR",
  "INDEX_PATH": "/mnt/optane/wpq/dataset/space/index/space1B_M20_PQ8_C4096_R_L2.faissindex",
  "QUERY_PATH": "/mnt/optane/wpq/dataset/space/query10K.i8bin",
  "GROUNDTRUTH_PATH": "/mnt/optane/wpq/dataset/space/space1B_L2_gt_k100.bin"
}
```

Additionally, modify macros in `./common/dataset.h`:
```cpp
// For sift1B
#define MY_PQ_M 32
#define DIM 128
#define QUERY_TYPE 0

// For space1B
// #define MY_PQ_M 20
// #define DIM 100
// #define QUERY_TYPE 1
```

## Data Format Specification
All datasets/queries/groundtruth use binary format. For sift1B:  
- **Dataset**: 2 × int32 (vector count + dimensions) + (vector count × dimensions × uint8)  
- **Training set**: Same as dataset  
- **Query set**: Same as dataset  
- **Groundtruth**: 2 × int32 (vector count + topk) + (vector count × topk × int32)  

Modify `/common/dataset.h` and `/host/util.cpp` for custom formats.
